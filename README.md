<h3>I. Object detection</h3>

The training and validation data for the object detection task will remain unchanged from ILSVRC 2014. The test data will be partially refreshed with new images for this year's competition. There are 200 basic-level categories for this task which are fully annotated on the test data, i.e. bounding boxes for all categories in the image have been labeled. The categories were carefully chosen considering different factors such as object scale, level of image clutterness, average number of object instance, and several others. Some of the test images will contain none of the 200 categories.
